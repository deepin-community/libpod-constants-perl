Pod::Constants version 0.19
===========================

Pod::Constants allows you to extract data from your POD at run-time,
meaning you can do things like declare constants in POD and not have
to update two places at once every time you make a change.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make

DEPENDENCIES

Pod::Parser, 1.13 or better.  That is to say, I haven't tested it on
any earlier version.
